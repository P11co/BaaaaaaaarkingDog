# encrypted-def (also known as BaaaaaaaarkingDog)
This repository contains codes created in the process of learning BaaaaaaaarkingDog's coding test preparation curriculum.
Big thanks to [BaaaaaaaarkingDog](https://github.com/encrypted-def) for creating the curriculum, and [sukam09](https://github.com/sukam09) for introducing me to such resources.
Most of my codes will be written before looking at the solution (unless I had great difficulty solving said problems) - allowing alternate solutions, or similar code with different syntaxes. I tend to adopt more comprehensible variable names and list out used libraries - a bit unconventional for a speed-coder - but it can bring about good coding conventions as well as be easier to read for those who have a hard time reading code. 
If my code ever helps anyone in their understanding, it would be my greatest honor. Good luck on your journey as well - it will be a long and rewarding one!
