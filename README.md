### [BaaaaaaaarkingDog's Algorithm Tutorial](https://blog.encrypted.gg/category/%EA%B0%95%EC%A2%8C/%EC%8B%A4%EC%A0%84%20%EC%95%8C%EA%B3%A0%EB%A6%AC%EC%A6%98)
Korean speed-coding and algorithms genius, [BaaaaaaaarkingDog](https://github.com/encrypted-def), writes his very own algorithm cookbook to get you up to speed with the basics and complexities of the algorithmic world! Many thanks to [sukam09](https://github.com/sukam09) for introducing me to the study guide. All credits to BaaaaaaaarkingDog for arranging the workbooks.

I tend to code in a more conventional style, over speed-coding-styles. The code will be open to all for educational purposes.
